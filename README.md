### _Yet another to-do list_

Todoo is, of course, a webapp to make to-do lists.

## Features

- Mark them as done
- Delete a todoo

_All todoos are saved. They won't go away on refreshing or restarting._

## Tech 
Todoo uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
- Angular JS
- Bootstrap
